#summary AIML Interpreter

Basically we don't need to impliment an interpreter to talk Burmese. We just need to select an intepractor that support Unicode. [http://www.alicebot.org/downloads/programs.html Interpreters] can be found here.

  * C# chat bot is too taxing to the server
  * Java implimentation seems to be the best interprater available. But I think Java version will also have the performance issue on server.
  * Kyaw don't like PHP and Perl, but you may like.
  * Pascal is out of trend, so as lisp.
  * Ruby variance has gone.
  * Many variance of C++ are available, some are immeture.
  * Python version is interesting but available in unstable version. Also no server version.

Anyways desktop application should be fine.
