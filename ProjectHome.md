Welcome to **Burmese conversation agent** - an **intelligent computer entity** to communicate with **Burmese**, the people live in Myanmar, in their own native language. In Burmese _Tar Tar Oo Lay_ means the lovely one who like to talk, hance this project aptly name **TarTar**.

**TarTar** is a a set of **AIML** contents providing basic functionality to communicate between Hunan and Computer. **AIML**, or Artificial Intelligence Markup Language, is an XML dialect for creating natural language software agents. The AIML was developed by Richard Wallace. It formed the basis for what was initially a highly extended Eliza called A.L.I.C.E. (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity), which won the annual Loebner Prize Contest for Most Human Computer three times, and was also the Chatterbox Challenge Champion in 2004. The AIML specification can be found [here](http://docs.aitools.org/aiml/spec/).

**TarTar**, a set of AIML contents for Burmese language, can be applied to any AIML intreprators supporting 1.0.1 unicode AIML, (see TarTarBrain for detail) providing basic functionality to communicate between Human and Computer in Burmese langauge.

**TarTar** can be easily extensible just by adding domain knowledge AIML contents, since AIML is an XML-compliant language that's easy to learn and create one from scratch within minutes.

## Usage ##
  * Download on of your favorate AIML intreprater from [AliceBot.Org](http://www.alicebot.org/downloads/programs.html) and get it ready.
  * Set **TarTar** AIML content to the intreprater. This is no more than copying to the appriorate folder in most intrepraters.
  * Modify few personalization, such as bot name and bot master.

## Application ##
The application of chat bot is growing rapidly in customer serving on the web sites.

We are also looking at MM-EN translation service, dictionary lookup service and some casual information service like Burmese calender and fortune telling in Burmese ways.
